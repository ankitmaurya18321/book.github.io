<p>Quran is a book of guidance. ALLAH SWT sent four books in order to guide people. ALLAH SWT revealed Psalm upon Prophet David PBUH, Torah upon Prophet Moses PBUH, Injeel upon Prophet Jesus PBUH and finally Quran upon Prophet MUHAMMAD PBUH. Holy Quran confirms the previous books/revelations and the Prophets. Muslims have to believe on these books otherwise they are not Muslims.</p>

<p>Holy Quran is a source of guidance for humanity and this is the last and final revelation of ALLAH SWT upon his last and final Prophet MUHAMMAD PBUH. This Quran has a solution to all of our problems and since no other book will come after this, ALLAH SWT made it perfect and for entire humanity. Today we see that Quran has scientific signs which are 100% accurate. Quran has predictions which have come to true like the miracle of Ramses II whose body is just found recently.</p>

<p>Holy Quran says to believe in one God which is the same God who sent Psalm, Torah and Injeel. The word ALLAH is used in old testament as ALAH which proves that the these books were sent by ALLAH SWT. People modified the books before Quran so there was a need for an intact book to last forever and that book is Quran. Quran has no errors. ALLAH SWT mentions in Quran that if this book was from someone else besides ALLAH, you would have seen errors in it.</p>

<p>The author of Quran is ALLAH SWT himself. It is not written by a human that is why ALLAH SWT challenges those who say that this book is not from ALLAH to bring a similar chapter like Quran. No one has been able to produce a single verse like Quran. Quran is a knowledge and it is a source of guidance to those who ponder. Quran was revealed in parts and it took 23 years to complete it.</p>

<p>Quran says believe in one God. Who has no son, mother, father or a wife. He is the most gracious and the most merciful. It deals with all the problems we face today. It is the only book which is still the same as ALLAH SWT sent it to Prophet MUHAMMAD PBUH. No human intervention is involved while other books have been modified and have errors.</p>

Quran is a miracle of ALLAH SWT. Muslims memorize this by heart form beginning till end so there is no way for anyone to change a single letter of Holy Quran. This is amazing. Every letter and word of Quran has a virtue.
